# sales-and-operations-planner

This project simulates a sales and operations planning using the zero-stock level strategy. The python code asks the user for the following data:
- An initial stock level for a product

- The number of month(s) to plan

- The planned sales quantity for each month

Based on this data, calculate the required production quantity as follows:

- If the sales quantity is smaller than the stock level of the previous month, the production quantity is 0

- If the sales quantity is larger than the stock level of the previous month, the production quantity is this difference
